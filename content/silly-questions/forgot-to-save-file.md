**The Answer:** You probably forgot to save the file! 🤦‍♂️

This is probably the most common mistake every developer makes, especially when starting out. You spend 30 minutes debugging why your changes aren't working, only to realize you never saved the file.

**How to avoid this:**

1. **Enable auto-save** in your editor (VS Code: `File > Auto Save`)
2. **Use Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S)** religiously after every change
3. **Check the file tab** - unsaved files usually have a dot or asterisk
4. **Use hot reload** in development - it will force you to save to see changes

**Pro tip:** Make saving a muscle memory. I save after every few lines of code, even if I'm not done with the thought. It's better to save too often than not enough!

Remember: The computer only knows what you've saved, not what you've typed! 💾
