sections:
  - title: "What we collect"
    body:
      - "Page view counts and upvote counts are stored anonymously in Supabase (PostgreSQL). No personally identifiable information (PII) is linked to these metrics — we record only the page type, slug, and counts."
      - "If you use the newsletter signup form, your email address is processed by Buttondown, our third-party email provider. We do not store your email on our own servers. See Buttondown's privacy policy at buttondown.email/privacy."
      - "We use basic analytics (view counts) built into the blog itself. We do not use Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, or any third-party advertising trackers."
  - title: "Cookies and local storage"
    body:
      - "We store a theme preference (\"light\" or \"dark\") in your browser's localStorage so your chosen appearance persists across visits. This is not transmitted to our servers."
      - "We store whether you have upvoted a specific post (using the post slug as a key) in localStorage to prevent duplicate upvotes. This is not transmitted to our servers and is fully local to your device."
      - "We do not set any tracking or advertising cookies."
  - title: "Third-party services"
