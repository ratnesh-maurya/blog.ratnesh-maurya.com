# Mastering TypeScript: From Beginner to Pro

TypeScript has become an essential tool for modern JavaScript development. Let's explore how to master this powerful language.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers several advantages over plain JavaScript:

- **Static Type Checking**
- **Better IDE Support**
- **Enhanced Code Documentation**
- **Easier Refactoring**
- **Catch Errors Early**

## Basic Types

Let's start with the fundamental types in TypeScript:

```typescript
// Primitive types
let name: string = "Ratnesh";
let age: number = 25;
let isActive: boolean = true;

// Arrays
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let names: Array<string> = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

// Objects
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

let user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Ratnesh Maurya",
  email: "ratnesh@example.com"
};
```

## Advanced Types

### Union Types

```typescript
type Status = "loading" | "success" | "error";

function handleStatus(status: Status) {
  switch (status) {
    case "loading":
      console.log("Loading...");
      break;
    case "success":
      console.log("Success!");
      break;
    case "error":
      console.log("Error occurred");
      break;
  }
}
```

### Generics

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

// Usage
let output1 = identity<string>("Hello");
let output2 = identity<number>(42);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use strict mode** in your `tsconfig.json`
2. **Prefer interfaces over types** for object shapes
3. **Use utility types** like `Partial<T>`, `Pick<T, K>`, etc.
4. **Avoid `any`** type whenever possible
5. **Use type guards** for runtime type checking

## Conclusion

TypeScript is a powerful tool that can significantly improve your JavaScript development experience. Start small and gradually adopt more advanced features as you become comfortable with the basics.

Keep learning and happy coding! ðŸ’»
