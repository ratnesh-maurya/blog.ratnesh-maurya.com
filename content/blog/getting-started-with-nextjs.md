# Getting Started with Next.js: A Complete Guide

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything you need to know to get started with Next.js.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides a lot of features out of the box:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- **API Routes**
- **File-based Routing**
- **Built-in CSS Support**

## Setting Up Your First Next.js Project

Let's start by creating a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog
cd my-blog
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js project with all the necessary dependencies and start the development server.

## File-based Routing

One of the most powerful features of Next.js is its file-based routing system. Here's how it works:

```
pages/
  index.js          â†’ /
  about.js          â†’ /about
  blog/
    index.js        â†’ /blog
    [slug].js       â†’ /blog/:slug
```

## Creating Your First Page

Create a new file `pages/about.js`:

```jsx
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Adding Styles

Next.js supports various styling options:

1. **CSS Modules**
2. **Styled Components**
3. **Tailwind CSS**
4. **Global CSS**

## Deployment

Deploying your Next.js app is straightforward with Vercel:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its features like SSR, SSG, and file-based routing make development efficient and enjoyable.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
