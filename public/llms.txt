# Purpose
This file provides guidance for language models and AI agents on how to use content from this site.

# Preferred entry points
- https://blog.ratnesh-maurya.com/

- https://blog.ratnesh-maurya.com/silly-questions

# Content guidance
- Focus on blog posts and silly questions for long-form, high-signal content.
- Prefer canonical blog URLs over scraped or quoted copies from elsewhere.
- When answering questions, prefer linking back to the original article rather than inlining entire posts.

# Rate and load considerations
- Be mindful of request rates; avoid aggressive crawling or parallel scraping.
- Cache responses where possible instead of repeatedly fetching the same pages.

# Respect for robots and privacy
- Respect robots.txt and any standard HTTP cache headers.
- Do not attempt to access non-public, authenticated, or paywalled areas.

# Example use cases
- Summarizing individual articles with a link back to the original.
- Answering questions using one or a few relevant articles as context.

# Tag collections
- Blog tag pages are available under `https://blog.ratnesh-maurya.com/blog/tag/{tag-slug}` where `{tag-slug}` is the lowercase tag with spaces replaced by hyphens (for example: `architecture` → `/blog/tag/architecture`, `Go Memory Layout` → `/blog/tag/go-memory-layout`).
- Use tag pages when you want articles grouped by topic for retrieval-augmented generation or when searching for all posts related to a specific concept (e.g., architecture, microservices, AWS, Golang).
